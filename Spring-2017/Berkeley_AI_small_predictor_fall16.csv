How Artificial Intelligence Constructs Human Preferences Through a Chat Conversation

 

Research in Collaboration with NYU Artificial Intelligence Research (NYUAIR)

 
Introduction





My name is Minah Jung. I am an assistant professor of marketing at New York University, the Leonard N. Stern School of Business.  I would like to invite you to take part in our research study that explores how people learn about preferences of others when having conversations with others in a chat room setting.

 
 Purpose





The purpose of this research study is to understand how artificial intelligence understands people‰Ûªs preferences through a chat room.

 
 Procedures





In this study, you will be asked to communicate with artificial intelligence who will engage in chat conversations about your preferences in a chat room setting. If you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked to communicate with Artificial Intelligence about your preferences on cultural consumption (e.g., movies, music, and food) via an online chat room for about 20-30 minutes. After the chat, you will be asked to complete a short survey about your chat conversation and other demographic information. This research is in collaboration with the NYU Artificial Intelligence Research (NYUAIR).


 
 Study time





The total duration of this study is about 30 minutes.

 
 Risk/Discomfort





-There is minimal risk to you from taking part in this research. The only risk to you from participating is the possibility that some of the tasks may make you feel a bit uncomfortable. You may discontinue participation or decline to answer any questions at any time. 

-Breach of confidentiality: As with all research, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised; however, we are taking precautions to minimize this risk.

 

Benefits

 

There are no direct benefits to you from this research.

 
 Confidentiality





Your study data will be handled as confidentially as possible. If results of this study are published or presented, individual names and other personally identifiable information will not be used.

To minimize the risks to confidentiality, we will do the following:

-               Your identity and data will not be linked.

-               Your research records will be stored on password-protected office computers.

-               Only I will have access to your study records.

-               Your personal information may be given out if required by law. We will keep your study data as confidential as possible, unless it is certain information that we must report for legal or ethical reasons, such as abuse or intent to hurt yourself or others.



Future use of study data

 

The research data will be maintained for at least 3 years for possible use in future research by myself.  The same measures described above will be taken to protect confidentiality of this study data.

 
 Compensation/Payment

In the beginning of this study, we told you that you
would be participating in a study about understanding how human preferences are
constructed and communicated and that you would be communicating with a person
who tries to understand your preferences by communicating with you. Our research
actually focuses on how
people perceive human vs. non-human interaction and their experience non-human
interactions with non-human entities (e.g., A.I.).  Although there has been a rapid increase in
adoption of A.I. in our daily lives, there is little research on how people
perceive their interactions with A.I. and their experience relative to their
interactions with humans.  In this study, we attempt to
better understand the underlying psychology in human vs. non-human
interactions.  

 

To
try and obtain unbiased or natural
reactions, we told you that your partner is a person who tries to understand
your preferences even though you interacted with an experimenter.  Unlike your case, some participants in this
study were told that they would be interacting with A.I. instead of a
person.  

 

This
was necessary for us to better
understand how people‰Ûªs belief about the ability of A.I. vs. human in accessing
their preferences. By telling you
that your partner was an experimenter, we could not have made reliable
inferences.  Without telling you that
your partner was an experimenter, we were able to set up a well
counter-balanced study we can analyze and infer the results concretely. We apologize for misleading you, but we believe this was the only way to examine the processes
that are the object of our research. In designing this study, we took care to minimize any possible risks or discomforts
that might be related to the deception.

 

Now that you
understand the true nature of our study, you have
the chance to refuse the use of the data we collected from you
for research purposes. You are free to ask us not to use your data in our study analysis. If you
decline to let us use your data, you
will still keep your payment
just as you would if we use your data
in our analysis. This is entirely
voluntary, but
we hope to analyze as much
data as possible to better
understand the processes by which
status hierarchies develop in groups.

 

Because this experiment is ongoing, we
request that you not share the true nature and purpose of this
experiment with others who might potentially participate in our study.

about this study, you may contact Minah Jung at (212) 998-0510 or minah.jung@stern.nyu.edu.
