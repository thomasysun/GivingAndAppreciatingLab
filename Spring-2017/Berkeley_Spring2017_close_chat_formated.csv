I definitely think that their strictness has rubbed off on me and therefore is unhealthy in my relationhip. I try not to be controlling / concerned all the time but that is just the way I was raised :confused:How about you? ,I was raised in the suburbs.

That way, if I don't like it, I can change what I'm doing today!how about yourself? ","That's an interesting perspective. I definitely think I would want something similar. If I could have one ability / quality, it would be to read minds. I feel like a lot of people are not saying what they are thinking and that can both good or bad at times","yeah thats a good one.

I played with the team since I was in 2nd grade, and we'd lost many times. It was a great feeling when we finally won state and went onto regionals in my junior year of high school.how about you? ","Oh wow, thats interesting that you mention that because in high school, I won my team state championships in tennis. But if I had to choose, I would either say that or getting into Haas :joy: :joy: :joy: ",haha nice nice.What    is    your    most    treasured    memory? ,"I think my most treasured memory is being at Disneyland with my girlfriend, under the lights of Mainstreet and looking up into the sky and seeing the beautiful fireworksEverything was so calm and peaceful in the midsts of all the chaos at Disneyland And you?

Why? sorry, i think you were supposed to ask that one i can answer first this time ",No I wouldn't.nah its fine lol ,haha sounds good,I believe in no regrets and so I dont regret anything haha,I would probably stop doing school and just focus on enjoying myself and spending more time doing what I like,oh nice hahaHow do you feel about your relationship with your mom? ,I have a great relationship with her. We talk amost everyday.How about you? ,awww that is so niceI think my relationship with her is good. She is really overbearing (which is where I get it) and so it kinda gets annoying at times So I'll share first regarding the embarassing moment ,okay sounds good.Share with your partner an embarrassing moment in your life. ,So I once ripped my pants during orchestra practice. So I called my parents to bring me a new pairWhen my dad came in He announced to the class Im here to drop off my son's pants because they ripped!  :flushed: :flushed: :grin: ,"lol classic parents. I'd say an embarassing moment was me was when I tried to start a club in high school, but there wasn't much interest and so it was kind of my first big moment of failure in high school.",aww :(When did you last cry in front of another person and by yourself ,"in front of others, probably in middle school in front of my parents. By myself, I cannot remember the last time I cried.You? ","I last cried in front of my girlfriend last week when she told me she doesn't know if she wants to continue our relationship and therefore go on breakMyself, the day after when I was alone thinking about it ","hope you're doing alright!If    you    were    to    die    this    e vening    with    no    opportunity    to    communicate    with    anyone,    what     would    you    most    regret    not    having    told    someone?
