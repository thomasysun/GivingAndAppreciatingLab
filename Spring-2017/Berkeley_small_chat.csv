We hiked for hours up to the very top of the fire trails at Cal. Nearing the top after a steep climb, we began to FREEZE because of the frigid wind and pouring. We decided it was a good time to stop, so we got on out trash bags and began mudslidign down the hill. We didn't get very far, but it was sooo fun! We saw soo much greenery - meadows, trees, bushes.

I literally just stapled cut pieces of a black sirt onto a white shirt and put on a red ribbon as a collar, and called it a day! I realized after that I was oen of the only people dressed up for halloween. It was hilarious. After a much needed nap, that night a group of people rallied to party in SF. My Dalmatian costume was soaked from the water slide I had gone down earlier, so I had to come up with a new costume. I grabed some white face paint, put it all over my face, and added a red blood mark on my mouth - vampire! Super fun!!"

It was fun going on some of the attractions that they have. However, I didn't enjoy seeing the animals trapped in cages. Thus, why I don't plan on going back to any zoo."

group 52,4/8/2016 22:47,R_2SeklTVSMNHMFPo,User 2,"Oh yeah, I feel the same way. I Have very mixed emotions about the zoo. I like seeing the animal, and hate that they're being trapped at the same time."
group 52,4/8/2016 22:48,R_2SeklTVSMNHMFPo,User 2,"The last time I was at the zoo was actually in Rome, Italy last semester. I was studying abroad and my family came to visit. We brought my little bro and my little cousin to a Zoo in downtown Rome. It was cool, but actually really sad. It was one of the most poorly-run zoos I've seen. The cages were to small, nothing was clean, not much water and it was so hot! I wouldn't go back either"

We met un in SF but my phone wasn't sending texts and he was late and on his bike so it was really difficult to initially find each other. Once we had, we planned to walk around the city and the pier but we ended up walking towards his place. The area was kind of empty but I didn't feel uncomfortable like I normally do when I'm out at night and there aren't a lot of people around. He had his bike with him and his bike lock kept hitting my hand by accident. It was nice, we talked a lot and walked to this artisan shop in his neighborhood. I made fun of him because our route didn't really have much sights to see- just a stadium parking lot."

I went to South Lake Tahoe and walked along a trail with my club Berkeley Innovation. It was my first time at Lake Tahoe and so I wanted to truly capture the experience. We hiked to the top of a mountain where there was a small stream and we also went to the beach near the edge of the lake. The sight seeing was beautiful and just being closer to nature and away from campus was definitely a stress reliever. I saw lots a wildlife such as chipmunks, geese, blue jays. I also bumped into a lot of other hikers and bicyclists. By the end of the walk my legs were definitely tired though. The most beautiful part of the day was seeing the sunset."

She had discovered an Amazon Wish list that I made years ago and forgotten about that had this eye shadow that I really wanted at the time. She mailed it for Hannukah along with some baked goods, noise-cannceling head phones I really needed (my laptop had broken and I was stuck in the noisy computer lab trying to get through finals), and some kettle corn (which ended up lasting me through the following two years). It was really nice because it was something I didn't even know she knew I wanted plus a bunch of things that reminded me of home or I was very much in need of at the time. I think it was so special because that it was my first time away from home for the holidays."

In terms of a broader gift, I think the best gift I have received is my education. This might sound cliche but I'm very thankful for my parents' financial and social support through my pursuit of academics. Both my parents were war refugees and did not get to finish learning. A lot of my family comes from a developing country where education is not necessarily a big priority compared to work in most rural areas. Being able to be at Berkeley was a dream come true and I know that I wouldn't be able to spend four years here learning and growing without my parents. So my college education has been the best gift.  But maybe that answer might not be"
group 91,10/14/2016 21:28,R_2TS3I02Q2zbTu3e,User 1,"as satisfying - so I guess the most recent physical gift I have received which left a huge impression on me was this red japser. It was a stone bought from this hippie novelty store in Lake Tahoe. One of the members of my club bought it for me without me knowing and it gave it to me later that night during  our night festivities. She told me that the stone would help me with my anxiety because I had expressed to her earlier that I was dealing with a lot of mental health issues. I definitely teared up and didn't know what to say. I didn't expect to receive such a gift, and even though it seemed like painted rock, at the end of the day, the symbolism behind the gift  really gave me good feelings."

I've always boycotted the holiday for a variety of reasons mostly having to do with my bad experiences as a kid with the festivities that always made me uncomfortable, although I do enjoy the fact of dressing up. Last Halloween was very similar to how I celebrated the halloween before: As a resident assistant I signed up for duty so that my other coworkers could go out and celebrate since the holiday wasn't very special to me. On duty I would check the building for safety hazards, drunk residents, and just make sure everyone was safe. Being on call, I had to handle a lot of lockouts. Sounds like a lot of work, but I probably also ate a lot of candy as well."

Now, she definitely has friends at her work and through family connections, but she still always emphasizes that her family is the most important part of her life."

group 91,10/14/2016 21:48,R_2TS3I02Q2zbTu3e,User 1,"If I got a haircut at the times that I would prefer most, I would probably get a haircut every 1.5-2 weeks since my hair grows really fast. But honestly, being so busy lately, I haven't gotten a haircut for like a month, so I continuously just wear hats all the time because my hair cannot be tamed! I usually just go to World cuts cause its convenient and cheap. But I have also probably had every bad haircut ever, from a choppy undercut to bowl shaped cuts...you name it. Really considering shaving my head so I don't have to deal with this problem."

Last year I was a ninja turtly (rafael, the rebel one), and I went to some big event down in San Diego. I paid like $60 for my ticket and only went for an hour because it was my Grandpa's 90th birthday party that year, and I wanted to spend extra time with my family. Ice cream time, whats your flavor??"
group 92,10/17/2016 19:34,R_WkDBL0xiBchh0xb,User 1,"I never watched Ninja Turtles but the costume is classic. My new ice cream flavor would be some type of sour gummy, with actually sour gummy chunks in it. It probably exists but its the first ""new flavor"" that came to mind! How about you?"
group 92,10/17/2016 19:36,R_2CrMpY5ENuxli9P,User 2,"Yum, is it lunch time yet?? This is so hard.. I guess if I had to invent one it would be nutella flavor with forerro rocher (spelling?) all crushed up in it. Ok what gifts did you get for your last bday?"

As for fun things that have resulted from this? Besides crazy nights out with my friends during weekends I guess when I stay up late it's usually because we're studying during dead week and we just end up eating lots of food and doing really silly things that might seem like we're slightly insane at times but its fun

group 181,2/15/2017 18:19,R_8wWZhKQYPut2jpT,User 2,Last time I walked for more than an hour was in my trip to Iceland during Thanksgiving. It's very beautiful and scenic. Would definitely recommend you to visit Iceland if you have the chance!
group 181,2/15/2017 18:20,R_33p5HuyoyvlZbRo,User 1,"So I walked for more than an hour last night when I went to go get pizza for a friend in Downtown Oakland. I went with another friend to get the pizza. I was a long walk, and it was dark. All the shops were open and people were funneling in and out. Also, there were a lot of police and helicopters around but I don't know why."

group 181,2/15/2017 18:22,R_33p5HuyoyvlZbRo,User 1,I got some flowers from a friend on Valentine's Day. It was very special because she knew that I wouldn't want me to feel left out of all the festivities because all of our other friends including her had boyfriends.

group 181,2/15/2017 18:32,R_8wWZhKQYPut2jpT,User 2,"ohhh!! haha yeah I totally feel. How about you? I know you said you love going to the zoo, so you'll probably have a more detailed description of your trip"
group 181,2/15/2017 18:32,R_33p5HuyoyvlZbRo,User 1,yeah i get that.... i usually dont like the zoo cause you see the same animals and you never get to see them all interacting with each other like you would in the real wild. but the last time i went it was in DC and i went with a bunch of co-interns/friends and we had an amazing time. I loveeee elephants so it was nice.
