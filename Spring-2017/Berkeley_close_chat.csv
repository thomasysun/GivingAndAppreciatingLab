We were hanging out playing videogames with a bunch of our friends in the living room. I had to fart so i did. Thank god it was a silent one because as soon as i did it i felt that something wasnt right. i went to the bathroom and disovered that was more than just a fart. I was wearing tan cargo shorts and a little wet spot could be seen. After cleaning myself up, i immediatley told my friends i had to go handle something. Luckily nobody noticed. Moral of the story is never trust a fart after a heavy night of drinking."
