Describe where you went and what you saw.,"The last time I walked for more than an hour was on a retreat last weekend. I went to South Lake Tahoe and walked along a trail with my club Berkeley Innovation. It was my first time at Lake Tahoe and so I wanted to truly capture the experience. We hiked to the top of a mountain where there was a small stream and we also went to the beach near the edge of the lake. The sight seeing was beautiful and just being closer to nature and away from campus was definitely a stress reliever. I saw lots a wildlife such as chipmunks, geese, blue jays. I also bumped into a lot of other hikers and bicyclists. By the end of the walk my legs were definitely tired though. The most beautiful part of the day was seeing the sunset.What was the best gift you ever received and why? ","One of the best gifts I ever received was from my mom Freshman year of college.

It was really nice because it was something I didn't even know she knew I wanted plus a bunch of things that reminded me of home or I was very much in need of at the time.

","I can't exactly remember the best gift I have received, especially since each gift throughout my life has definitely had significant meaning to me. In terms of a broader gift, I think the best gift I have received is my education. This might sound cliche but I'm very thankful for my parents' financial and social support through my pursuit of academics. Both my parents were war refugees and did not get to finish learning. A lot of my family comes from a developing country where education is not necessarily a big priority compared to work in most rural areas. Being able to be at Berkeley was a dream come true and I know that I wouldn't be able to spend four years here learning and growing without my parents. So my college education has been the best gift.  But maybe that answer might not beas satisfying - so I guess the most recent physical gift I have received which left a huge impression on me was this red japser. It was a stone bought from this hippie novelty store in Lake Tahoe. One of the members of my club bought it for me without me knowing and it gave it to me later that night during  our night festivities. She told me that the stone would help me with my anxiety because I had expressed to her earlier that I was dealing with a lot of mental health issues. I definitely teared up and didn't know what to say. I didn't expect to receive such a gift, and even though it seemed like painted rock, at the end of the day, the symbolism behind the gift  really gave me good feelings.

I've always boycotted the holiday for a variety of reasons mostly having to do with my bad experiences as a kid with the festivities that always made me uncomfortable, although I do enjoy the fact of dressing up. Last Halloween was very similar to how I celebrated the halloween before: As a resident assistant I signed up for duty so that my other coworkers could go out and celebrate since the holiday wasn't very special to me. On duty I would check the building for safety hazards, drunk residents, and just make sure everyone was safe. Being on call, I had to handle a lot of lockouts. Sounds like a lot of work, but I probably also ate a lot of candy as well.If you could invent a new flavor of ice cream, what would it be?
