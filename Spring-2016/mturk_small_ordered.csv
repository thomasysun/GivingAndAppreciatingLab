group 1015,2/1/2016 2:29,R_1LNjs33QUCV9Ikq,User 2,"I actually don't go to concerts much because my hearing is very senstive due to some hearing loss in the left ear.  Last time I went to one was maybe 2001 and if I recall right the band was VNV Nation.  They are okay, but it was more an excuse to get away from my parents."

It took several friends to convince him that is how I am when I wake up from a heavy nap."

I used to go to salons, but I realized I was sort of wasting my money.  I once got a haircut where I asked for it to be medium length and parted on the side, and they just kept cutting and cutting.  It eventually was a crew cut.  But, you know, it grows back so whatever."

We discuss our day and the funny things that happened and just tell jokes and have a good conversation to either start our day or finish our day. Never know where the conversations will lead but it is always interesting. :smiley:

group 787,1/29/2016 6:39,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,I visited the college I graduated from and went to a few parties with some friends
group 787,1/29/2016 6:39,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,How did you celebrate last Halloween?
group 787,1/29/2016 6:39,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,I didn't do anything :/
group 787,1/29/2016 6:40,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,"That isn't always the worst thing, it is nice to stay in sometimes"

group 787,1/29/2016 6:40,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,"Alright, #3:  If you create a new flavor of ice cream, what would it be?"
group 787,1/29/2016 6:41,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,"I am a huge ice cream fan, and the only foods that I love more than ice cream are cookies and bacon, so because there is already a lot of cookie flavors out there, I guess I would try out some sort of bacon flavored ice cream"
group 787,1/29/2016 6:42,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,I bet it already exists :P
group 787,1/29/2016 6:42,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,That's the problem with this question though.  Anything that would be good is probably already made...
group 787,1/29/2016 6:42,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,"I wouldn't be surprised haha. If you create a new flavor of ice cream, what would it be?"
group 787,1/29/2016 6:43,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,"I'm trying to think, but I don't know..."
group 787,1/29/2016 6:43,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,My flavor would be revenge.
group 787,1/29/2016 6:43,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,It's best served cold and tastes sweet.
group 787,1/29/2016 6:44,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,That is thinking outside the box
group 787,1/29/2016 6:44,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,:)

group 787,1/29/2016 6:44,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,Number 4:  What is your favorite holiday?  Why?
group 787,1/29/2016 6:45,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,Thanksgiving because it is when family comes together without the pressures of having to give gifts and all the other problems commercialism has created around Christmastime
group 787,1/29/2016 6:46,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,What is your favorite holiday? And why?
group 787,1/29/2016 6:47,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,That's true.  I think mine might be 4th of July.  It's in the summer and it's fun.
group 787,1/29/2016 6:47,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,"That's my number 2, I just normally have to work on that day which is a bummer"
group 787,1/29/2016 6:48,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,I see.
group 787,1/29/2016 6:48,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,"Alright, next is #5.  What gifts did you receive on your last birthday?"
group 787,1/29/2016 6:48,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,"I received a vinyl record player and some vinyl records, along with a deep fryer."

group 787,1/29/2016 6:52,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,"I can't actually remember the last time I went to the zoo, it was probably 15 years ago..."
group 787,1/29/2016 6:52,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,"Haha, it is. But it was cold out, and around Christmas time. I was with my girlfriend and the zoo puts up a really cool Christmas display all over, so it was awesome to look at, especially at night"
group 787,1/29/2016 6:52,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,That does sound kind of cool.
group 787,1/29/2016 6:52,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,"That was like 4 years ago for me haha, I don't make it out to a zoo too often"

group 787,1/29/2016 6:53,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,Sunny.
group 787,1/29/2016 6:53,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,I think it was the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky.
group 787,1/29/2016 6:54,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,That's about the best I can do :S

group 787,1/29/2016 7:02,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,"Clocks with the hands, because I think it just looks classier and more professional"
group 787,1/29/2016 7:02,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,Your preference?
group 787,1/29/2016 7:03,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,No real preference.  I don't really like the ones with hands and no numbers though.
group 787,1/29/2016 7:03,R_41O9RDdhAMNmi8V,User 1,I guess maybe I lean slightly to digital.  I want to know exactly what time it is :P
group 787,1/29/2016 7:03,R_1gMwxyzKpxeMdle,User 2,That is the benefit

group 80,1/10/2016 3:06,R_73xvHA4LQ2ey253,User 1,Last week I went to a park in Des Moines and walked around a lake.

There is something appealing about watching the hands move around the dial.

We don't have a TV so pretty much go to bed when we're tired which may be at dusk or then again maybe at 10 or 11 pm.
